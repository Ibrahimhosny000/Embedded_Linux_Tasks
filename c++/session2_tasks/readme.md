# Tasks for session2 (c++)
-----------------------------
## task1:-
### create a function to find the maximum number of array :-
```bash
description:
	this code gets the maximum number in an array with two wats
```
```bash
first approch:-
by loop iterating on the array and a condition to compare them
to get max number
srconf approch:-
by sorting the array ascending order and then gets the last element
```
```bash
output sample:
first approch  -->  Max number is array is --> 333
second approch -->  From array { 3 2 55 3 16 3 15 46 }
		    max number is : 55
```
##
## Task2:-
### create a function to search for a number in the array :-
```bash
this code searches for a number in a given array
```
```bash
output:
Enter the number you want to search for
if the number is there for example 2
out --> your number: 2 is in the array at index 1
if the number is not there for example 2314
out --> NOT found
```
##
## Task3:-
###  create a function to delete a number in the array :-
```bash
this code delete a number from an array
```
```bash
output: Enter the number you want to delete from array 
for example 2
out --> The intial array is 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
The array after deleting the number is: 
1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
```
##
## Task4:-
###  create a function to merge two arrays together :-
```bash
this code takes two arrays and merge them together by two ways
```
```bash
first way; by taking two fixed arrays
output --> array after merging array1 + array2 is: 
	   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 
```
```bash
second way; by taking values of the two arrays from the user
--for example:-
out ->  Enter the size for first array
MAX SIZE '10' : 3
Enter 3 elements for first array
1
2
3
Enter the size for second array
MAX SIZE '10' : 2
Enter 2 elements for Second Array: 9
8
--the outputs the merged array as followed
Array after merging array1 + array2 is: 
1 2 3 9 8 
```
##
## Task5:-
### find the even and odd numbers in the array :-
```bash
this code has two partition 
the first: takes number from user to see if it is even or odd in the array
the second: display all the even and odd numbers in array
```
```bash
first:;
out --> Enter the number you want to see if odd/even   for example 1
-- if it is in the array
output; 1 is an Odd number in the array 
-- if it is not in the array   for example 12
output; number '12' is not in the array 
```
```bash
second:;
output: 
Even numbers are: 
2 4 6 8 10 14 22 
Odd numbers are: 
1 3 5 7 9 13 
```
##
## Task6:-
### Write a lambda function to calculate the square of a given number  :-
```bash
this code takes a number from user and get it's square by lambda methos
```
```bash
example:-
out --> Enter a number to see its square 
input --: 2
output: square of '2' is --> 4
```
##
## Task7:-
###   Write a lambda functions to sort an array of integers in ascending and descending :-
```bash
this code takes an array and return it sorted assending/decending orders by lambda method
```
```bash
output:
numbers in ascending order: 
1 2 6 12 13 22 55 65 89 124 
---------------------------
numbers in descending order: 
124 89 65 55 22 13 12 6 2 1 
```
