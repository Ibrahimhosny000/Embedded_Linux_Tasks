| Char  | ASCII |
+-------+-------+
|           32  |
|   !       33  |
|   "       34  |

This code takes 3 numbers then diplay which is bigger
input:
1
2
3
```
```bash
output:
Max number is 3
```
##
## Task3:-
### right angele triangel :-
if you want to determine if a right angel triangel by angles
if you want to determine by angles
```bash
Enter three angles of a triangle to
determine if it's a right angel triangle
```
```bash
-if right angel triangle:
output: These angles add up to
A Right Angle Triangle
-if not:
output: This triangle is not a Right Angle Triangle
-if entered angles are not for a triangle:
output: Theses angles does not add up to make a triangle
```
if you want to determine by sides:-
```bash
Enter three sides to determine if
Right Angle Triangle: for example 3 4 5
-if right angle:
output:This is a right angel triangle
The hypotenuse is 5
-if not a righg angle triangle: for example 2 3 4
This is 'NOT' a Right Angle Triangle 
```
##
## task4:-
### Decide if a letter is vowel or not :-
```bash
enter a letter to see if vowel or not:-
```
```bash
-if vowel entered for example a:
output:The enterd letter 'a' is a vowel
if not a vowel for example z:
output:letter z is 'NOT' a vowel
-if anything other than a char is entered for example @:
output:@ is not a letter
```
##
## task5:-
